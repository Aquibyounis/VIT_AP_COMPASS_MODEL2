What is the difference between applying for leave through VTOP and applying for leave manually?,LLaMA,"So you want to know about leave applications here at VIT-AP.

**Through VTOP:**

1. You submit your leave application online through the VTOP portal.
2. Your mentor reviews and approves your request.
3. Once approved, you can check your leave status in the VTOP system.

**Manually (by email):**

1. You send an email to your mentor requesting leave.
2. If approved, your mentor sends a confirmation email to their superiors (wardens).
3. The warden then issues a leave form for you to fill out and submit.
4. After submitting the form, you're marked as absent in the VTOP system.
